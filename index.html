        <h3 id="section-about">About</h3>
        <p>I’m a versatile developer with a strong foundation in both back-end and front-end technologies, passionate about creating responsive, high-performance user interfaces. My work sits at the intersection of design and development, where I strive to build interactive experiences that are not only visually compelling but also optimized for usability and speed.</p>
        <p>I’m currently expanding my expertise in front-end development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complement my extensive back-end knowledge. My journey includes building scalable applications, contributing to full-stack projects, and developing a complex video game in Unity, showcasing my ability to handle projects end-to-end.</p>
        <p>My experience includes extensive back-end development in the legal domain, where I contributed to building and maintaining applications that handle complex fees and fines management for the law sector. Working directly with user-end attorneys provided valuable feedback, which helped refine the system's features and ensure it met the practical needs of legal professionals. This experience has honed my skills in designing robust back-end solutions that prioritize data integrity, scalability, and user feedback.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, you’ll find me coding new features for my game, learning the latest front-end technologies, or exploring the outdoors for inspiration.</p>
